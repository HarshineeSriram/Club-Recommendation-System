Join us for a series of artist talks, panel conversations and keynote presentations.</p>\n<p><b>Peter Morin</b>\u00a0is a grandson of Tahltan ancestor artists. He has now lived away from his home territory for most of his life, but like his ancestors who have walked on the land, he carries Tahltan knowledge, ideas and history with him wherever he is. Every step along the way, Tahltan knowledge has guided his researching, dreaming, learning, making of the past twenty years of artistic and curatorial practice.</p>\n<p>Morin began art school in 1997, completing his Bachelor of Fine Arts at Emily Carr Institute of Art and Design in Vancouver in 2001 and his Masters in Fine Arts in 2010 at the University of British Columbia Okanagan. Initially trained in lithography, Morin\u2019s artistic practice moves from printmaking to poetry to drum-making to button blanket making to installation to beadwork to performance art.</p>\n<p><a class=\"btn ok-btn-primary\" href=\"https://ubc.zoom.us/meeting/register/u5AtcO6gqTopGtRq_yCBzXsHSSKnOy0HP-7f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Register Now</a></p>",
