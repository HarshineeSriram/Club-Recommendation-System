The end of the word, 'us' represents\nthe organization as a group of students, educators business leaders who all work together to change the\nworld. Enactus has an important focus on the development of its student members. As members we are\nable to network with business leaders and learn up-to-date business and leadership skills at training\nconferences that are held throughout the year by the Enactus organization. Our projects allow us to step\noutside the comfort of the classroom to apply our knowledge to real solutions that affect real people.\nThis hands-on learning approach is key as we seek opportunities, brainstorm solutions and carry them\nout. When you join Enactus, you are not just in another student organization. You are applying the skills\nyou have learned in class to positively impact the world.

        "description": "What is the Sex Positivity Club (UBCOSPC)?\nThe UBCOSPC is a student association run by\na team of passionate students who want to open up a positive, inclusive dialogue about sex with\ntheir peers on campus. Our primary goals are to: (1) destigmatize sex, sexuality, and sexual\nhealth on campus by providing a safe, inclusive, non-judgmental space where students can\ndiscuss important topics, (2) educate students about the resources available to them on and off\ncampus, so they can make active and informed decisions about their own sexual health, and (3)\ncollaborate with other student associations, campus initiatives, and local organizations to\npromote safer sex practices within our campus community.\n\nHow does the UBCOSPC operate?\nThe UBCOSPC acts as a club and meets periodically\nthroughout the year via discussion groups and workshops. One of our most successful events we\nran this past year was a workshop called BDSM 101, which was designed to debunk common\nmyths about BDSM and educate students on how to practice kink safely and responsibly, with a\nheavy emphasis on consent and communication.\n\nWhat benefits will I get for joining the UBCOSPC?\nThe biggest benefit is you get to speak with likeminded students and build community with those who also care about sexual health! Throughout the year we run multiple giveaways, some including sex toys and some including experiences with local organizations. When you come to our meetings, you get extra entries into these giveaways, which you are definitely going to want! When we are back in-person, we will also have free condoms, lube, resources, and refreshments available for students at each and every one of our meetings and events.\nInstagram: @ubcospc\nhttps://youtu.be/1DLS_MqTw6I\n",

        "description": "The purpose of the Engineering Society is to provide social, professional, and academic services as well as representation to all UBC Okanagan engineering students. The Engineering Society is made up of a council of representatives from all student years and disciplines. The Engineering Society advocates for engineering student needs and brings academic issues to faculty, ensuring the needs of students are met during their time at UBCO.\n\nEvents organized by the Society include social opportunities such as E-Week, EngFrosh, games nights, and BBQ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, and services such as the Energy-to-Go station during finals. The Engineering Society also hosts professional events including Professionalism Week, Resume Roast, and the Iron Pin ceremony. The Engineering Society represents our student body at a regional and national level, and works to keep students connected to external engineering organizations including APEGBC, WESST, and CFES. Through these connections, students can attend conferences and competitions such as the Western Engineering Competition, the Canadian Engineering Leadership Conference, the Conference on Diversity in Engineering, and many more.

        "description": "The Microbiology course Union aims to provide an enriching academic and social environment to anyone who is interested in Microbiology, or Biology in general. The MCU is led by enthusiastic Microbiology majors who are dedicated to providing an exciting and welcoming experience. We provide midterm review sessions for several Biology courses, and hold open office hours to provide extended support to students in Biology.\n\nWe also run fun and engaging events such as laser tag and bowling, and we're planning to participate in the Canadian Cancer Society Relay for life.\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/microbioubco/",
